# paymentbillingsystem
implemented using spring mvc and spring
I have taken a project called "paymentbillingsystem" from javatpoint site. The project was implemeted using UI tools only (JSP, Javascript, Ajax).
I have converted the project into MVC model by using spring mvc and spring jdbc.
This project is helpful to understand the basic features of spring mvc and spring jdbc.
